# Solve Me First
This repository contains a solution to the **"Solve Me First"** coding challenge.

## The Challenge

The challenge asks you to write a function called `solveMeFirst()` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in Python. The code includes a sample input and output.

### Code Example

```python
def solveMeFirst(a, b):
    # Hint: Type return a + b below
    return a + b

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
res = solveMeFirst(num1, num2)
print(res)
```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Save the code**: Save the code in a Python file, for example, `solve_me_first.py`.

2. **Run the code**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the script using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python solve_me_first.py
   ```

3. **Enter the inputs**:
    - You will need to enter **one number**, then press **Enter**.
    - Next, enter the **second number**, and press **Enter** again.

4. **View the output**: The program will print the sum of the two numbers entered.

### Example
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 6
11
```

## Explanation

- The `solveMeFirst()` function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.
- The main part of the code reads two integers from the user using the `input()` function, calls the `solveMeFirst()` function to calculate their sum, and finally prints the result.
